#eventually elimate the page to the music part no titles using AI ---- use AI to convert an image to sheet music

#seperate the blac knote into two different things and make sure we have the big line thing implemented
#first things first let's fix up the replacement part
#WE COULD MAYBE MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT VERSION WHERE IT CHECKS THE OUTSIDE AND THEN WORKS ITS WAY IN on all of the things like newyindex newxindex



#this is what i'm working on now:
#need something special for the white note

#could do a fancier white strategy but truthfully it would make miniscule difference and take too much effort
#this could be later efficiency step
#the idea is you would expand out of the white note


#WE COULD MAYBE MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT VERSION WHERE IT CHECKS THE OUTSIDE AND THEN WORKS ITS WAY IN on all of the things like newyindex newxindex
#do it w any of the loops
#we can make the y in range loop sfaster by making the second for loop contingent on the first one working if not continue or some shit maybe opposite idk
